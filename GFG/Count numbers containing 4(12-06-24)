You are given a number n, Return the count of total numbers from 1 to n containing 4 as a digit.

Examples:

Input: n = 9
Output: 1
Explanation: 4 is the only number between 1 to 9 which contains 4 as a digit.
Input: n = 14
Output: 2
Explanation: 4 and 14 are the only number between 1 to 14 that contains 4 as a digit.
Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

//java solution
class Solution {
    public static int countNumberswith4(int n) {
        // Explorer Swapnil
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (containsDigitFour(i)) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    public static boolean containsDigitFour(int n) {
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 10 == 4) {
                return true;
            }
            n = n / 10;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
