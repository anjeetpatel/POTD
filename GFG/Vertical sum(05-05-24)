Given a binary tree having n nodes, find the vertical sum of the nodes that are in the same vertical line. Return all sums through different vertical lines starting from the left-most vertical line to the right-most vertical line.

Example 1:

Input:
       1
    /    \
  2      3
 /  \    /  \
4   5  6   7
Output: 
4 2 12 3 7
Explanation:
The tree has 5 vertical lines
Line 1 has only one node 4 => vertical sum is 4.
Line 2 has only one node 2 => vertical sum is 2.
Line-3 has three nodes: 1,5,6 => vertical sum is 1+5+6 = 12.
Line-4 has only one node 3 => vertical sum is 3.
Line-5 has only one node 7 => vertical sum is 7.
Example 2:

Input:
          1
         /
        2
       /
      3
     /
    4
   /
  6
 /
7
Output: 
7 6 4 3 2 1
Explanation:
There are six vertical lines each having one node.
Your Task:
You don't need to take input. Just complete the function verticalSum() that takes root node of the tree as parameter and returns an array containing the vertical sum of tree from left to right.

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).

Constraints:
1<=n<=104
1<= Node value <= 105



//java solution
class Solution{
    public ArrayList <Integer> verticalSum(Node root) {
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return result;
        }
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> verticalSumMap = new TreeMap<>();
        verticalSumUtil(root, 0, verticalSumMap);
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : verticalSumMap.entrySet()) {
            result.add(entry.getValue());
        }
        return result;
    }
    private void verticalSumUtil(Node root, int verticalLine, TreeMap<Integer, Integer> verticalSumMap) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        verticalSumMap.put(verticalLine, verticalSumMap.getOrDefault(verticalLine, 0) + root.data);
        verticalSumUtil(root.left, verticalLine - 1, verticalSumMap);
        verticalSumUtil(root.right, verticalLine + 1, verticalSumMap);
    }
}
